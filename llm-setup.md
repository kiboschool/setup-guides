# Large Language Model (LLM) Setup

LLMs are tools that you can use to help with textual tasks, like brainstorming, summarizing, editing, or writing.

When learning to code (or learning some other subject), it's often helpful to ask questions and get help from an LLM:

> "Explain what's wrong with this code"
> "Help me understand what's causing this bug"
> "Can you help explain this CSS property? I don't get it"

If you ask questions like this, you can get quick answers from the model.

The model isn't always correct - it can make mistakes (just like asking a friend) - but it is often better than nothing.
